# Untitled Multiplayer Tile Game

A multiplayer grid-based video game that requires players to rely on teamwork and communication through posts, chats, and talking. Capture enemy pawns by moving on a grid, but you can only move once.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Overview
The game is a multiplayer game where players interact on a shared grid. Each player controls pawns belonging to their team and can only make one move within 12-24 hours. The limitation of moves encourages a slow and collaborative gameplay by making players rely on communication features, such as the team-based bulletin board and the global chat room.

## Core Features
- Shared grid-based map where players move pawns representing their team across the board

- Move-limited gameplay that retricts the number of moves a player can make every 12-24 hours
